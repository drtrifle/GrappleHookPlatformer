Final Ninja is a platformer that allows the player to throw shurikens to damage enemies as well as to swing from them when the left mouse button is held down. When swinging, the player cannot jump or attack.

The aim of the game is to reach the end of the level while collecting as much  stacks of cash as possible. There are a variety of enemies in this game as well as a boss fight in the final level.

There are some stealth mechanics in the sequel Final Ninja Zero where the player is invisible to enemies when they stay still for a few seconds

*Target Platform*

Desktop (if have time, mobile)

*Mechanics*

Similar to Final Ninja, the player moves using the arrow keys/ WASD and jumps with space. They fire a grappling hook using the left mouse button and cancel an existing hook with the right mouse button. While attached to the grapple hook, they can move up/down on the rope using the up/down or W/S keys.

*Goals*

The aim of this game in any level is to reach the end of the level as fast as possible while collecting as much collectibles as they can. Bonus points if they can accomplish it with full health / no kills etc.

*Constraints*

Player is unable to jump when the grapple hook is deployed. Player is also unable to grapple to certain surfaces

*Story*

Player plays as a master theif that steals rare items. The levels progresses from a mansion to an art museum to even a secret government facility.
